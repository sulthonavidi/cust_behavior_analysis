# Customer Behavior Analysis
Data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Power BI.

## Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior to identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights.  
It covers the complete data analytics workflow from raw data processing to dashboard visualization and reporting.

The project includes:
- Loading dataset using Python  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Cleaning and preprocessing data  
- Running SQL queries in PostgreSQL  
- Building an interactive Power BI dashboard  
- Creating a final report and presentation  

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related information such as:

- Customer ID  
- Transaction date  
- Product category  
- Purchase amount  
- Region or customer segment  

This data is used to understand customer purchasing behavior and performance trends.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- PostgreSQL (SQL analysis)  
- Power BI (Dashboard visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Microsoft PowerPoint  

## Project Workflow
1. Load dataset in Python  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Clean and preprocess the data  
4. Store cleaned data in PostgreSQL  
5. Run SQL queries for insights  
6. Build Power BI dashboard  
7. Create report and presentation  

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:

- Customer spending trends  
- Purchase frequency analysis  
- Category performance  
- Key KPIs and metrics  

Interactive filters allow dynamic data exploration.

## Results & Insights
- Identified high-value customers and key segments  
- Discovered purchasing patterns over time  
- Improved data quality through cleaning  
- Delivered insights through clear visualizations
